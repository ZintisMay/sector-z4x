          You've finally done it, your scientists have discovered faster than
          light travel. As you aim your starships at the sky, you soon learn you
          are not alone.

          First contact is followed by second and third, and it becomes clear
          that there are many civilizations in the galaxy. Mostly small,
          together they form the Senate, a collaboration between all the
          sentient races of the galaxy. The Senate has a strong influence over
          the galaxy, as all the races come together for a common purpose for
          the good of the many (or maybe just the few).
        </p>
        <p>
          After much deliberation, you decide to ensure your species' best
          chance of survival, you will integrate yourselves into the galactic
          community, take a leading role in the Senate, and lead the galaxy into
          the next era.

          I'm currently in talks with publishers and also continuing development
          to make this the best 4X game it can be!
        </p>
        <p>
          Which is where you come in! I'm looking for fans of the genre to help
          me polish off the mechanics, content, arc and feel of the game. If you
          or someone you know would like a fast, smooth-playing grand strategy
          4x game, sign up below!
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend to run playtests on Tabletop Simulator (a game platform for
          board games), and if you are willing to commit to a couple playtests,
          will even buy it for you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Playtesters who play 3 full games will be provided a copy when
          published!
